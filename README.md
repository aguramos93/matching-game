## Matching game
A first version (v1.0) of the classic tile-matching memory game, developed with C++ and Qt framework. 

This repo is created with the idea of ​​updating and improving the game developed by: https://github.com/programacion-desde-cero/Emparejados

## Rules 
12 tiles are displayed, as well as a countdown starting at 1:00. User needs to click on two tiles and try to match the images they show. If there's a match, score increases. If no match, score descreases.
Whenever 2 tiles are matched, they remain uncovered. If no match, tiles are turned back after a second. User wins when all tiles have been matched or loses if the time is up before all matches could be made.
After the game is over, the user can choose to play again or quit the game.
No levels or anything, just a simple game.
